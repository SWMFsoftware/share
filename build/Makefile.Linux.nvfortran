#!ROUTINE: share/build/Makefile.Linux.nvfortran - one of the original files for Makefile.conf
#!DESCRIPTION:
# This Makefile is copied from share/build/ into the Makefile.conf in the 
# main directory during installation or reinstallation. 
# Makefile.conf contains the operating system and compiler specific 
# part of the SWMF Makefiles. Makefile.conf should be included into
# all makefiles which compile Fortran code so that the compiler options 
# are consistent for all object files and libraries.
# It also defines an OS and COMPILER specific clean target.
#
# This particular makefile is for the Linux operating system with the 
# nvfortran compiler, but its documentation is relevant for all makefiles 
# in share/build. The name of the makefile is 
#\begin{verbatim}
# Makefile.${OS}.${COMPILER}
#\end{verbatim}
# where OS contains the operatings system (e.g. Linux) 
# and COMPILER contains the name of the F90 compiler (e.g. nvfortran).
# The whole Makefile.Linux.nvfortran is included into the manual, 
# so that all the definitions and compilation rules are shown. 
# These definitions and rules must be provided by all makefiles in
# the share/build directory.
